      "message" : " \nCitizenfour \n \nDuring the holidays I watched a documentary called Citizenfour that concerns Edward            \nSnowden and the NSA spying scandal that you may have heard about that began in 2013. I                 \nthought that it would be interesting to come back on this case and its current consequences                \nbecause it raises lots of questions that are concerning everyone in a society where we               \nconstantly deplore the end of our privacy.  \n \nHow does the controversy around Edward Snowden illustrate the inability faced by            \nour modern societies to reconcile national security and privacy ?  \n \nFirst, I'll talk about the revelations made on the NSA's illegal activities, then about the               \ndivision generated by it and finally I'll summarize the current situation. \n \nI Snowden’s revelations case \n \nA The context  \n \nThe 5th of june 2013, the famous british newspaper The Guardian published on its website a                \nhighly classified document from the NSA, the National Secret Agency of the US revealing              \nthat datas of billions of Americans were recovered without their consent. The man behind              \nthis revelations was Edward Snowden : an IT engineer. He had worked for the CIA and then                 \nhad been hired by an NSA contractor to develop surveillance programs for the NSA use.               \nSnowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was             \ninvolved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was               \nignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to ​Hong Kong after leaving his job at an ​NSA                 \nfacility in Hawaii​, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to               \njournalists ​Glenn Greenwald​ and ​Laura Poitras​. \n \nB The content of the revelations \nThe ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a             \nglobal surveillance machine run by the ​United States in close cooperation with three of its               \nfour ​Five Eyes partners: Australia, the UK's ​GCHQ​, and Canada.The first surveillance            \nprogram to be revealed was PRISM which allows direct access to American’s Google,             \nFacebook or Yahoo accounts. The Washington Post revealed that the NSA was paying U.S.              \nprivate tech companies for clandestine worldwide access to their communications networks.           \nIt was also revealed that a secret court order required the American telecommunication             \ncompany Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans’ phone records daily including             \nemail content, tracking and mapping the location of cell phones.  \nC His motivations \nSnowden declared that his sole motive was to inform the public that what is done in the                 \nname of their security is done against them. He accused the USA to violate the American                \nright guaranteed by the Constitution to have a private life but also the democracy. He adds                \n \nthat 90% of those placed under surveillance in the U.S. are ordinary Americans with no links                \nwith terrorism. \n \nII The controversy around Snowden \n \nA The reaction of the US government  \nOn June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against             \nSnowden, charging him with theft of government property and the violation of the Espionage              \nAct of 1917 through unauthorized communication of national defense information to an            \nunauthorized person. According to the government, this surveillance could be justified as a             \nlegal interpretation of the Patriot Act of 2001 to fight against terrorism. At the end of 2013,                 \nSnowden obtained asylum in Russia before a permanent residency. In 2019, Snowden he             \nasked the French government to grant him asylum but France keeps refusing.  \n \nB The division of the public opinion  \nFor Snowden’s accusers, the whistleblower had been too far by stealing and disclosing             \ndocuments related to the national security. It brought to light a part of the international               \nactivity of the NSA that we can be considered as essential for security such as the spying on                  \nthe wife of one’s of Ben Laden’s associate. According to a report of the House of                \nrepresentatives from 2015, if the revelations didn’t harm directly the American citizens,            \nthey’ve led to a disruption in the legal collect of information and may have caused               \nconsiderable damages for the national security They speak in favor of a judgement and a               \ncondemnation of Snowden’s acts.  \nOn the other hand, Snowden partisans consider him as a national hero. If they don’t deny                \nthat he disrespected the law by revealing highly classified documents, they plead that his              \nrevelation of illegal US government activity sparked a global debate and that he did it for the                 \npublic interest. Privacy is a human right and he did his duty revealing this violation.               \nMoreover it resulted in ​the US government passing laws for the first time in decades               \nrestricting government surveillance as we will see in a third part.  \n \nIII Privacy nowadays \n \nA Legal changes  \nEven if the massive surveillance on Internet didn’t stop with the Snowden's revelations,             \nsome progress has to be underlined. In 2015, the congress adopted for the first time in its                 \nhistory a law reducing lightly the powers of the intelligence services. Indeed, the Freedom              \nAct force the NSA to present specific reasons in order to obtain someone’s datas. However,               \nthis Act only applies to American citizens allowing the NSA to pursue its actions abroad. In                \nothers countries such as Germany or Brazil, Snowden’s revelations opened a political            \ndebate about the practices of their intelligence services. It also was used as a striking               \nargument in some negotiations especially at a European level. The General Data Protection             \n \nRegulation adopted by the European Union in may 2018 was a result of a debate caused by                 \nthe Snowden’s documents.  \n \nB Technical changes \nTechnical changes that took place on Internet are at least as important. The links between               \nthe US administration and the Big digital companies had been drastically damaged since the              \nSnowden case. Technical measures had been taken by the firms to protect their users. The               \nencryption of the communications had been widespread. An increasing portion of the            \nInternet traffic is from now one unreadable by outsiders giving protection against the             \nintelligence services willingness to listen. By the bye, this new measures are a source of               \ntensions, in 2015 Apple refused to give access to an Iphone despite the FBI request within                \nthe scope of a terrorism investigation.  \n \nC National security or privacy ?  \nMore generally, the Snowden case and the the division about the fate he has to undergo                \nillustrates the dilemma of our modern societies. The development of digital devices has             \nstrengthened the international terrorism but offers, at the same time, the capacity to fight it               \neven if this includes a danger for our privacy : the limits aren't easy to fix. Both security and                   \nprivacy are protected by the law and it’s mission hard to determine which one should prevail                \non the other not only in the USA but worldwide as we've experienced it in France with the                  \ndebates around the urgency state. To conclude, we may wonder if a balance truly exists as                \nwe know that surveillance by its nature is secret and can't be democratic.  \n \n \nMarie-Sarah Deviller \n",
